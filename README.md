**ASTRA (`Attack Surface Threat Reconnaissance Arsenal`) is an automated security assessment and management platform designed to streamline and orchestrate the entire reconnaissance and initial vulnerability analysis workflow.**

It provides a clean web-based user interface to manage security assessment projects, define scope, and run a series of powerful, open-source security tools in a structured and repeatable manner. The primary goal of ASTRA is to automate the tedious parts of a security assessment, allowing security professionals to focus on manual testing and deeper analysis.

## ‚ùØ Features

- **Intuitive Web Interface:** Manage projects and targets through a modern and responsive frontend.
- **Modular Reconnaissance:** Select and run from a wide array of reconnaissance modules.
- **Live Task Monitoring:** View the real-time output of running scans directly in the browser via WebSockets.
- **Structured Workflow:** A logical, multi-stage process from subdomain discovery to vulnerability scanning.
- **Organized Results:** All tool outputs are systematically saved and organized by project, making data correlation and review straightforward.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Easily add new modules and tools to the backend.

---

## ‚ùØ Architecture

ASTRA is built with a simple yet powerful client-server architecture:

-   **Backend:** A Go (Golang) server that exposes a REST API for project management and a WebSocket endpoint for live recon output. It acts as the orchestrator, managing the execution of various command-line security tools based on the selected modules.
-   **Frontend:** A vanilla HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS single-page application that provides the user interface for interacting with the backend.
-   **Tooling:** The platform integrates a curated list of best-in-class, open-source security tools to perform the actual scanning and analysis.

---

## ‚ùØ Workflow

The typical workflow for conducting a security assessment with ASTRA is as follows:

1.  **Project Creation:** Start by creating a new project, giving it a unique name.
2.  **Scope Definition:** Define the project's scope by adding target domains, wildcards, and out-of-scope targets.
3.  **Module Selection:** Navigate to the "Deep Recon" page and select the reconnaissance modules you wish to run for the current project.
4.  **Execution & Monitoring:** Start the reconnaissance task. The backend will begin executing the selected modules in a logical sequence. You can monitor the progress and see the live output from the tools directly in the web UI.
5.  **Review Results:** Once the scan is complete, all artifacts and tool outputs are stored in the `results/<project-name>/` directory. You can then analyze this data for potential vulnerabilities.

## ‚ùØ Reconnaissance Modules & Tools

ASTRA's power comes from its modular workflow, where each module is responsible for a specific part of the reconnaissance process and utilizes one or more specialized tools.

| Module | Purpose | Tools Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `subdomain_discovery` | Discovers subdomains for the target scope. | `subfinder`, `amass`, `assetfinder`, `chaos` |
| `probe` | Checks which of the discovered subdomains are live and accessible via HTTP/HTTPS. | `httpx` |
| `portscan` | Scans for open ports on the discovered subdomains. | `naabu` |
| `urls_crawler` | Crawls live websites to find URLs and endpoints. | `katana`, `hakrawler`, `gau` |
| `js` | Finds and analyzes JavaScript files for secrets, endpoints, and vulnerabilities. | `getjs`, `subjs`, `nuclei` (exposures), `mantra`, `linkfinder` |
| `tech_detect` | Identifies the technologies used by the target web applications. | `wappalyzer` (via `httpx`) |
| `hidden_parameter` | Discovers hidden parameters in URLs that could be vulnerable. | `gf` (various patterns), `unfurl`, `arjun` |
| `fuzzer` | Fuzzes web applications for hidden files, directories, and vhosts. | `ffuf` |
| `vuln_scan` | Performs broad vulnerability scanning using Nuclei templates. | `nuclei` |
| `xss_scan` | Scans for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. | `qsreplace`, `dalfox`, `ffuf` |
| `sqli_scan` | Scans for SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities. | `sqlmap`, `gauri` |
| `screenshot` | Takes screenshots of live web applications for visual inspection. | `aquatone` |

## ‚ùØ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get your ASTRA instance up and running.

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- `git`
- `go` (version 1.17+)
- `python3` and `pip`
- `npm`

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nullqore/ASTRA.git project-astra
cd project-astra

```

### 3. Install Tools

The project includes a comprehensive setup script to install all the required security tools. Make it executable and run it.

```bash
chmod +x install_tools.sh
sudo ./install_tools.sh
```

**Note:** This script will install numerous packages and binaries onto your system using `apt`, `go install`, `pip`, and `npm`. Review the script if you have any concerns.

### 4. Build and Run the Backend

Compile and run the Go server.

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Build the binary
go build -o bin/server cmd/server/main.go
# Run the server
./bin/server

or

go mod init
go run cmd/server/main.go

```

The backend server will start on `localhost:8080` by default.

### 5. Access the Frontend

No web server is needed for the frontend. Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.

```bash
# From the project root directory
open frontend/index.html
# Or navigate to file:///path/to/project-astra/frontend/index.html in your browser
```

---
```bash
ps aux | grep toolname //check tool running status
```

## ‚ùØ Results Structure

All output from the reconnaissance process is saved within the `results/` directory, neatly organized by project and module:

```
results/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <project_name>/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scope/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ subs/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ httpx/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ active/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ urls/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ portscan/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jsurls/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vuln/
```
